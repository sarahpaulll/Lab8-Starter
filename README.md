Graceful degradation and service workers are related because they are both methods to provide the user with a functional webpage even when it is on an older browser or device. In the lab we saw how service workers can be used to still have our webpage work when it's offline. Ensuring that the webpage works offline can be considered graceful degradation since we ensured that the webpage still worked even without internet, which is similar to the previous labs when we used graceful degradation to ensure it still worked without javascript.
